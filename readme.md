Uptime monitoring app with text alerts via Twilio

###This Project
The reasoning behind this project was twofold:
1. I wanted to build a sample program in raw Node.js without the use of ANY server framework (Express, Hapi, etc.) and without the use of ANY third-party npm modules. As such you will see there is no `package.json` or `node_modules` in the project directory. Everything is built with core Node modules.
2. I also wanted to build it in a way that does not use callbacks. Yes, a Node API without callbacks. The API, handlers, network communication, and internal libs to manipulate data are all constructed with Promises and heavy use of async/await syntax. I wanted to see where this approach would get me and how much the readability/maintainability of a raw Node.js project could be improved by eliminating 'callback hell'.

###Conventions used:
Lately, I have been teaching myself Golang/Go, and wanted to get used to one of its idiosyncracies: explicit error checking. This is a big departure from JavaScript, which has an exception-handling control structure built in--arguably making it easier for developers to ignore them. I wanted to get used to thinking about errors and dealing with them on the spot.

In Go (Go functions can return multiple values):
```Go
data, err := db.Query("SELECT ...")
if err != nil { return err }
```

To aid in this, I used a small utility function called `to` that receives a promise and resolves the response to an array in the structure `[rejectedError, resolvedData]`, echoing the Node convention of error-first callbacks. It eliminates the need to put `await` statements in `try/catch` blocks or chain `.catch()` calls on promise expressions. 

ex:
```javascript
let [err, data] = await to(_data.read('users', phone));
```

In addition, all routing and response handling is done via promises with async/await. It may seem counterproductive to write an application without callbacks in a language that champions first-class functions--where higher-order functions are commonplace in server logic, but hey, this is just an exercise in curiosity. I wanted to use as many core Node modules as possible while experimenting with the practicality of using promises and async/await to fully replace callbacks in a Node app.
